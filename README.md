# My-Personal-Website
This website is a showcase of my coding learning journey. I started learning how to code in early 2020. Under Covid-19 quarantine circumstance, I decided to start my coding journey. It has been full of excitement, frustration and sometimes procastination as it is a part of one's learning curve. So far I am quite proud of myself for how much effort I have put in this project. Yet there are still room for improvement. This site is always a on-going project as I am learning more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
